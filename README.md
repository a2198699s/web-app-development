# Get, Set, Pet!
A totally awesome web application for rating pets. Create an account and upload pictures of your favourite pet, and while you're at it, browse and rate the selection of pets already uploaded by other users!

## Features

If you have your own pet to show off, once you've created an account and clicked on the upload page you will be taken to a page with all your previous uploads. From there a modal appears asking you to enter details about the new pet which you'd like to upload.

When you arrive at the home page, you will be greeted with the newest uploads on the site. If you are logged in, the ability to vote on others pets will be unlocked. The average vote given to that pet will be displayed as paws inside the pets card.

### Categories

If you're sick of seeing cats appear on your timeline, and want to filter them out. Why not just select a different category and exclusively browse and rate pets of a certain species?
